# ClassificationOfMicroplastics

The problem of microplastic particles has emerged as a significant ecological issue because of the extensive accumulation of plastic waste in the oceans. The ingestion of microplastics by marine organisms has also become a concern as it results in microplastics entering the food chain and causing unpredictable effects on human health. Researchers are investigating the presence of microplastics in both fishes and coastal areas. However, this task is time-consuming due to the need for regular campaigns to measure their abundance in the samples.

To address this issue, this project presents a novel approach for automatically counting and classifying microplastic particles. This method is believed to be the first attempt to tackle this complex problem. It employs Computer Vision techniques to analyze the acquired images of the samples and Machine Learning techniques to develop accurate classifiers for various types of microplastic particles.
